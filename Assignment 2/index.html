    <h3 style="font-size:15px;color:burlywood;text-align:right;">That's why it's called a short bio</h3>
    <p id="p-1">My name is <b>Andrew Reynolds.</b> I'm <i>23 years old</i> and I <del>was born</del>live in <strong>Mesa, Arizona</strong>. I took an <mark>interest</mark> in coding because a <sub>good friend</sub> of mine from the military pursued a <sup>career</sup> in the field. He's happy with his job, makes a good living, and learning how to do something with computers sounded like a <small>challenging and interesting</small> a career choice. <ins>I hope that by finishing this program at sdgku I can gain an entry level position in the industry to grow a career</ins>.</p>
